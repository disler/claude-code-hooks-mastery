# Voice Command Results TTS Enhancement - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the development of an enhanced text-to-speech (TTS) feature for the Claude Code hooks system. The enhancement will provide immediate audio feedback for concise command results, improving developer productivity and user experience by delivering real-time voice notifications for short command outputs.

This document serves as the comprehensive specification for implementing voice command results functionality within the existing Claude Code ecosystem, ensuring seamless integration with current workflows while adding valuable audio feedback capabilities.

## 2. Product overview

The Voice Command Results TTS Enhancement is a productivity feature that automatically converts short command outputs into speech using the ElevenLabs TTS API. The system intelligently filters command results based on word count and tool type, speaking only concise outputs (≤20 words) to avoid overwhelming users with verbose responses.

### 2.1 Key capabilities
- Automatic speech synthesis for short command results
- Intelligent content filtering based on tool type and output length
- Configurable voice settings and tool exclusions
- Non-intrusive operation that maintains existing Claude Code workflows
- Robust error handling with graceful fallbacks

### 2.2 Integration scope
The enhancement integrates directly with the existing Claude Code hooks system, specifically extending the PostToolUse hook to process tool responses and trigger TTS when appropriate. The solution leverages the current ElevenLabs TTS infrastructure while adding intelligent content processing and user configuration options.
